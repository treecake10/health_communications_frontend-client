# Health Comm. Patient/Client Application 

Used by a patient to make requests for appointments with doctors approved to visit based on the list of approved doctor families set by the doctor or receptionist on the admin complement application.
A patient is also able to select their Primary Care Physician that is approved by an administrator beforehand. 

After a doctor schedules a date and time off, if the patient is assigned to the doctor and the patient goes to make an appointment with them for the same day the doctor schedules off, 
the patient will get back a list of available times to select which has filtered out the time taken off by the doctor on that particular day.

After a patient successfully makes an appointment request on the doctor selection page, the new request can be viewed on the homepage as an expandable accordion that contains all of the appointment 
details pending an approval status by the administrator, whether to accept or decline the appointment as a whole.
